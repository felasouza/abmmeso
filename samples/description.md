In this folder we add examples and sample studies that have been done using this framework.

Although we try our best to keep up to date, it is possible that some code may not be operational after code updates. This is the reason that each example is shipped with the commit/version in which the code was based on.

For general examples, we require to have tests for them in the test section.
